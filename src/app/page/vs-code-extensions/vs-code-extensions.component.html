<h4>Visual Studio Code extensions which help you to be more productive</h4>
<p>
  Every day I'm writing a lot of JavaScript code. And also creating HTML
  templates and defining styles for them.
</p>
<p>
  So, this means that I have a lot of routine tasks which are eating my time,
  but I can't avoid them.
</p>
<p>
  But, I'm using a
  <app-external-link [href]="codeUrl">Visual Studio Code</app-external-link>!
  And this IDE has a lot of
  <app-external-link [href]="codeMarketUrl">extensions</app-external-link>
  which are making my life easier.
</p>
<h5 id="{{ tsLintAnchor }}">
  <app-external-link [href]="tsLintUrl">TSLint</app-external-link>
</h5>
<p>
  A real-time linter for TypeScript files.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, this extension will highlight errors. Moreover, TSLint will show
  the possible fixes list.
</p>
<p>This extension also has an auto-fix feature for most common mistakes.</p>
<h5 id="{{ typescriptHeroAnchor }}">
  <app-external-link [href]="typescriptHeroUrl"
    >TypeScript Hero</app-external-link
  >
</h5>
<p>
  This extension is a real life-saver because it can sort imports and remove
  unused imports, etc.
</p>
<p>
  And thus enables you to have pretty and clean code: no more "spaghetti"
  imports - life is beautiful!
</p>
<h5 id="{{ prettierAnchor }}">
  <app-external-link [href]="prettierUrl">Prettier</app-external-link>
</h5>
<p>The only thing this extension can't handle is to organize imports.</p>
<p>
  All other tasks performed with brilliant ease and speed, and this is awesome.
</p>
<p>
  Any messy file will become human-readable in a matter of fractions of seconds
  once you save it.
</p>
<p>
  Also, this extension supports a lot of file types and able to format not only
  code.
</p>
<p>
  On the list of supported types where is Python, Java, C#, CSS, LESS, JSON,
  etc.
</p>
<h5 id="{{ intelliCodeAnchor }}">
  <app-external-link [href]="intelliCodeUrl"
    >Visual Studio IntelliCode</app-external-link
  >
</h5>
